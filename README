DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is Rcs::Agent, version 1.04, an object oriented RCS perl library, used
for creating and manipulating RCS archives within perl programs.  

Rcs::Agent is copyright (C) 2001 - 2007 Network Ability Ltd.  All rights
reserved.  This software may be redistributed under the terms of the license
included in this software distribution.  Please see the file "LICENSE" for
further details.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

A Unix or Unix-look-alike.  Rcs::Agent will almost certainly not run under
non-unixy systems.

The following perl modules are also needed for Rcs::Agent to run properly:

String::ShellQuote-1.00
File::Temp

These (and many other) useful packages are available from your local CPAN
archive, or http://www.perl.com/.   File::Temp is included with the base
distribution of perl 5.7 and above, so if you're running this version or
anything more recent, there's no need to install this module.


INSTALLATION
------------

tar -xvzf Rcs::Agent-1.XX.tar.gz
cd Rcs::Agent-1.XX
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

BUGS & SECURITY
---------------

Rcs::Agent is coded carefully with security in mind.  Like all code,
however, there is a possibility that bugs or security problems have slipped
through the net.  If you find a problem with the code, please email us at
rcs-agent /at/ netability.ie, detailing the problem, and providing a patch
if possible.

In particular, we recommend that all developers use the 'tmpdir' parameter
when creating new objects to ensure that RCS does not use /tmp for its
temporary files.  Please see the man page for more details on this.
